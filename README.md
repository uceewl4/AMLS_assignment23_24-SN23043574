### 3. Disease Diagnosis with Images -- DDI
> Designed for both radiologists and patients who resort to digital diagnosis supported by powerful AI solutions. The system is implemented with Streamlit package in Python as core design tool and the real-time diagnosis is backed by models constructed above.

## Requirements
  Original developing environment:
  - Visual Studio Code 1.85.0 (Universal)
  - **CPU platform:** Python 3.11.5.final.0 and Anaconda virtual environment for conda 23.7.4. You can check all requirements in requirements.txt and environment in environment.yml. 
  - **GPU plaform:** UCL server: london.ee.ucl.ac.uk with Python 3.11.5.final.0, Anaconda virtual environment for conda 23.7.4 and cuda version 12.2.
  - System deisgn: Streamlit package in Python (https://docs.streamlit.io/)
  - Notice that some system functions like *Feedback* and *Help* need to ensure internet connection for email.

## Usage
- Step 1: Create environment with corresponding version mentioned in **Requirements** with Anaconda Navigator.
- Step 2: Install requirement packages for the environment: 
  <p><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></p>
  It's also ok for you to combine step 1 and 2 together to run:
    <p><code>conda env create -f environment.yml</code></p>

Two projects are provided under this Github link. The first one is a project with only models but not provided dataset. The second one is a backup project with both raw dataset and preprocessed dataset provided. Notice that even if you use this project instead of the backup one, there is no need for you to copy/replicate/downnload any datasets, because the program will download it automatically in Datasets/ for you.

**<font color=red>**Notice:** There are no difference in other codes of these two datasets.If you want to check code validation for the dataset part, you can use the first one. It may take some time for you to generate preprocessed data due to the large size of task A and B. You can also download .zip backup project and run it with preprocessed dataset provided. But please unzip the backup project in separate window. Please follow the corresponding instructions for different choices, otherwise there may be some errors. Thanks a lot.</font>**

**If you want to run the project to check dataset:**
- Step 3: There are two datastes for each task. The first one is .npz(with .csv) and the second one is a directory with all .png images. Notice that you don't need to copy/replicate/download them, the program will download automatically for you if you set the argument "pre_data" as True. For each task, please don't set pre_data as True again in your next command if you already set it as true before,otherwise it will be preprocessed again and generate error.However,if you already set pre_data for task A as True before, you still need to set pre_data as True for task B(if task B hasn't been download and preprocessed before.). In conclusion, it's necessary to set pre_data as True for each task in your first command (if you don't use backup project) as follows. But please don't repeat setting it as True in subsequent commands.
  <p><code>python main.py --pre_data True</code></p>
  <p><code>python main.py --pre_data True --task B --method NB</code></p>

  **<font color=#008000>Notice that the argument of pre_data must be set as True to download datasets and check data preprocessing initially. There are several other arguments which can be specified to select different model scenario. Default scenario is LR baseline for task A. You can specify the argument as follows:</font>**

    --task: task A or task B, default A

    --method: model selected, default LR. for ML baselines, specify related name as "LR", "SVM", etc. For customized networks, specify related name as "MLP", "CNN", "EnsembleNet", etc. For pretrained networks, specify pretrained model with classifier as "DenseNet201_LR", "VGG16_SVM", etc. For clustering method, specify related name as "KMeans". 

    --batch_size: batch size of customized MLP and CNN, default 32.  **only used for MLP and CNN.**

    --epochs: epochs of NNs, default 10. **only used for MLP and CNN.**

    --lr: learning rate of NNs, default 0.001.  **only used for MLP and CNN.**

    --pre_data: whether download datatsets and perform data preprocessing, default False. **<font color=red>must be set as True for this project where you don't have any data and want to check the process of data preprocessing, no need for backup project. For each task, in initial running you should set pre_data as True, once you download and preprocess the dataset, please don't set pre_data for this task as True again otherwise it will be preprocessed again and generate error. However,if you already set pre_data for task A as True before, you still need to set pre_data as True for task B(if task B hasn't been download and preprocessed before.)In conclusion, it's necessary to set pre_data as True for each task in your first command (if you don't use backup project) as follows. But please don't repeat setting it as True in subsequent commands.</font>**

    --multilabels: whether set multilabels scenario, default False.  **only used for task B MLP and CNN.**

  <p><code>python main.py --task A --method SVM</code></p>
  <p><code>python main.py --task A --method MLP --batch_size 32 --epochs 10 --lr 0.001</code></p>

  **<font color=#008000> Notice: Due to large size of dataset and model nature, some model may be extremely slow to run epecially for task B. It can take several hours to run customized networks and other pretrained models with GPU. So it's suggested that if you want to check the model implementation on CPU, try some fast model to see their performance as recommended:</font>**

        task A: LR, SVM, NB, DenseNet201_LR, KMeans, etc. (You can try MLP/CNN around 30-60min on GPU or can set a small epoch on CPU to see NNs performance. Apart from tree family, most of task A models are quick.)
        task B: NB, LR, MLP, KMeans, etc.(It will take you some time to load dataset of task B. For MLP/CNN you can set a small epoch to see performance)

- To run DDI system:
  <p><code>streamlit run interface.py</code></p>

  **<font color=red>The system can only be run with all dataset and preprocessed one already prepared. You cannot run it with only codes provided. </font>**

  To upload diagnostic image as a patient, you can select a .png image in your corresponding **<font color=red>preprocessed dataset</font>**.
